## Abstract

Hiring is considered to be the single most important people activity of any company, and has a special significance in the technology sector: Developer demand is high and assessing developer culture fit and knowledge is hard, and requires a cross functional effort, ranging from marketing and promotion to code interviews and tests.

The goal is to provide a quick and efficient hiring process for developers by:

* Providing a standard workflow for finding and selecting candidates

* Providing templates for different candidate profiles

* Creating and maintaining a pool of freelancers 

* Creating and maintaining a queue of potential candidates for employment


We will try to base the workflow on industry standards and best practises. The following books and materials can provide important insights on the hiring process of developers and will be used as a base for our workflows:

* Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams

* [Harvard business review](https://hbr.org/topic/hiring) 

* [Work rules!](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790)

* [7 simple rules for hiring great developers ](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2609792/it-careers/7-simple-rules-for-hiring-great-developers.html)

## Process Overview

Hiring the right developer can have a very long runtime.  Therefore it makes sense to implement **_continuous hiring_*** *and manage **_candidate pools_** and **_freelancer pools_** to manage peak workloads.

### Finding candidates

...

* Knowing what you are looking for: developer profiles

* How to find them: on-site job offers, paid job offers,  networking, company self-promotion, developer outreach.

#### Networking

Social media networks or other interesting platforms that developers tend to use are twitter, github*,  facebook, maybe google +, less so Linkedin.


Try to use social media to tap into the social circles of friends and employees.

….

#### Company self promotion

In the recruiting world, tech talent has become like diamonds: They're hard to extract, everybody wants them, and even people who have a lot want even more. So it’s very important to build a employer brand and start building a relationship with the community.

This includes creating a brand that developers can relate to (and motivate), promote that brand where developers hangout (online on twitter, conferences, hackerspaces), stickers and cool t-shirts.

#### Developer outreach

…

#### Scouting and headhunters

Github and similar sites allow [you to search and source ](http://www.socialtalent.co/blog/how-to-use-github-to-find-super-talented-developers)candidates either directly. Another possibility is to hire professional headhunters to do that job for you. Trying to contact the developer is easier if done through a network, as some developers get dozens of emails a week. The book* **[Managing the unmanageabl*e](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Unmanageable-Insights-Software-People/dp/032182203X) has a useful chapter on scouting and headhunters.
